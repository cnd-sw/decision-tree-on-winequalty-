# decision-tree-on-winequalty-
applying machine learnign's decisson tree on winequality daaset

Train a best fitting Machine learning model for the given wine dataset to predict the quality
of the wine. Vary the values of atleast one hyperparameter and Plot the training accuracy and
Test accuracy.
Explain your results, and Analysis at the end of the notebook in a separate cell (create a
markdown cell and explain)
Do the data exploration, preprocessing, feature selection as per your requirements.
Comment very section for better code walkthrough.
Note: Wherever Random parameter is used in any Sklearn module use a constant seed value
for reproducing the results.
Important Note: Split the dataset into Train and Test (80: 20 ratio) 

Data Set Characteristics:
Number of Instances: 4898
Number of Attributes: 11 predictive attributes and the target variable
